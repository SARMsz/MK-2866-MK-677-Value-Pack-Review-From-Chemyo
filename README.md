<h2>What Is the MK‑2866 and MK‑677 Stack?</h2>
<p><strong>MK‑2866</strong>, also known as <em>Ostarine</em>, is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) that promotes <em>lean muscle growth</em> and improves <em>bone density</em>. <strong>MK‑677</strong>, or <em>Ibutamoren</em>, is a growth hormone secretagogue that raises <em>GH</em> and <em>IGF‑1</em> levels, aiding <em>muscle recovery</em>, sleep quality, and appetite stimulation. Together, they form a powerful <em>body recomposition</em> stack.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product from Swisschems</h2>
<p>To evaluate purity and performance, I ordered directly from Chemyo, a verified Swisschems supplier. I checked third‑party lab reports for >99% purity and found accurate dosages. I used five criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity &amp; Lab Testing:</strong> Confirmed by COA from an ISO‑certified lab.</li>
  <li><strong>Efficacy:</strong> Speed of muscle gains, strength increases, and recovery times.</li>
  <li><strong>Value:</strong> Cost per milligram versus buying each SARM separately.</li>
  <li><strong>Shipping &amp; Support:</strong> Fast delivery and responsive customer service.</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Feedback:</strong> Verified reviews on forums like Reddit and SARMs boards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I gave it a <strong>4.8/5</strong> rating. Purity and results were top‑notch, and the bundle price matched the advertised <em>10% discount</em>.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<p>I ran an eight‑week cycle with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MK‑2866:</strong> 25 mg each morning.</li>
  <li><strong>MK‑677:</strong> 20 mg at night.</li>
</ul>
<p>By week 4, my <em>bench press</em> went up by 15 lbs and my recovery time after squats dropped from 72 to 48 hours. I gained 6 lbs of lean mass while losing 2 lbs of fat. Sleep improved—I felt rested and my joints tightened up less. Appetite increased, which helped on training days but required me to track calories to avoid unwanted fat gain.</p>
